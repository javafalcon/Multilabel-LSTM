### Multilabel time series classification with LSTM
Tensorflow implementation of model discussed in the following paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03677">Learning to Diagnose with LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks</a>.

### Tools Required
Python 3.5 is used during development and following libraries are required to run the code provided in the notebook:

* Tensorflow
* Numpy
* Pandas

### Dataset
<p>Cleaned version of MIMIC-III <a href="https://github.com/YerevaNN/mimic3-benchmarks">dataset</a> and accompanying <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07771">paper</a></p>

<p><a href="http://mimic.mit.edu/mimicdata/whatsnew/">MIMIC-III</a> dataset can possibly be use to train and test the model. Beware this is not the data set used by the authors of the paper.</p>


<i>Note: If you see mistakes, want to suggest changes or have dataset that can be use to train/test the model, please submit a pull request.</i>
